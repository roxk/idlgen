[![CI](https://github.com/roxk/idlgen/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/roxk/idlgen/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

A library for generating idl files when implementing WinRT components. Currently, only C++ is supported.

## Installation

Use your preferred way (cli/GUI) to install the nuget package `IdlGen.IdlGen.Cpp`, which can be found on [nuget gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdlGen.IdlGen.Cpp/).

## Usage (C++)

### Overview

1. Edit the header file of your implementation type.
2. Build the project. A custom build step would run before compilation.
3. Viola! The idl file of the implementation type has been updated.
4. Try deleting the idl file and re-run, you should see the idl file being generated again.

The library would generate the whole runtimm class definition for you. There should be literally zero edit you need to make on the resultant idl file.

The library could automatically generate the following structures in an idl files:
1. Runtime class definition, if an implementation type is found
2. All (static) getters, setters, methods, events
3. Import file for an implementation type, if the implementation type is referenced in the runtime class' properties/methods, etc

The library would not generate the following:
1. Attributes
2. Interfaces and base class
3. Import file of projected types, value types, and enum referenced in the runtime class' properties/methods, etc
4. Structs

To help the tool generate these missing pieces, the library defined the following custom attributes, which, when declared for a class, would cause the library to generate the missing pieces.

### Idlgen Custom Attributes

The syntax for idlgen's custom attributes is
```
[[clang::annotate("idlgen::$attribute=$args")]]
```

The library currently utilize clang's annotate attribute to specify an inner attribute, following C++'s `namespace::attribute(args)` convention. `=` is used instead of `()` to simplify parsing.

Below is a table for all attributes and their usage.

|Attribute|Args|Description|Example Declaration|Resultant idl|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|`import`|`value,value,...`|Add import statement(s)|`[[clang::annotate("idlgen::import=A.idl,B.idl"]]`|`import "A.idl";import "B.idl";`|
|`attribute`|`value`|Add an attribute|`[[clang::annotate("idlgen::attribute=default_interface")]]`|`[default_interface]`|
|`extend`|`value`|Add base class and interfaces|`[[clang::annotate("idlgen::extend=WUXC.Page,WUXD.INotifyPropertyChanged]]`|`$yourClass : WUXC.Page,WUXD.INotifyPropertyChanged`|

### Other Tips

|What to achieve in IDL|What to do in header|
|--|--|
|Hide event handler in XAML|Make the handler private, set `friend struct ClassT<Class>`|
|Hide event handler for any other runtime class|Make the handler private, add `friend ClassT<Class>`|

This is because for XAML `ClassT` is a struct, for any other runtime class it is an alias template.

### Property property

|Name|Description|
|--|--|
|`IdlGenCppGenerateIDL`|Master control to configure whether idl files are generated|
|`IdlGenInclude`|Control which and only files to include|
|`IdlGenExclude`|Exclude the files from generating idl|

## Troubleshooting

#### The library failed to generate idl file for my implementation type

The tool needs to parse the header file as if it's compiling it, so _all_ necessary headers have to be included. Make sure you add all necessary includes in the header file. It's suggested that you add `pch.h` to all header files to ease include effort. There should be no additional compilation penalty.

#### I made a mistake in the header file, and the library generated an idl file that cannot be compiled! Now the project is stuck at failing to build idl and cannot re-generate the idl...

Relax. First, copy the old content from `.idl.bak` generated by the library so that the build system can finish the idl building phase. Next, fix your header file.

If you are in the heat of refactoring a class in a header file and do not want the tool to generate idl at all, you can add the header file to property `IdlGenExclude`, either manually or via VS's project property page.

## CI or Dev(Inner)-Loop consideration

Since idl files are meant to be included in the source, there is no need to generate these idl files in CI (Continuous Integration). The library provide an option to control generating idl files (`IdlGenCppGenerateIDL` for C++). .Make sure you set this property to `false` in CI.
